This version of the autosplitter works with every split-file (.lss) for Biohazard / Resident Evil 1 from here: https://www.speedrun.com/residentevil/resources

There are 3 possible ways to use this autosplitter:

1. I DON'T WANT THE NEW AUTOSPLITTER - I WANT TO USE THE OLD AUTOSPLITTER
- Start your Livesplit and load up the biohazard splits you like to run
- If Livesplit downloads the new autosplitter automatically, open the "Splits Editor" (right click - edit splits)
- On the right side under the attempts counter there is a button "Deactivate" - click it
- Close "Splits Editor"
- Open "Layout Editor" (right click - edit layout)
- Click the "+"-Button
- Choose "Control" - "Scriptable Auto Splitter"
- Select your autosplitter (.asl) and click "OK"
- You are now using your autosplitter

<i>NOTE: The old autosplitters will only work with the old split-files because the split-names are connected to each other.</i>

2. I WANT TO USE THE NEW AUTOSPLITTER AND THE NEW SPLITS
- Download new split-files (.lss) from https://www.speedrun.com/re1/resources
- Start your Livesplit and load up the biohazard splits you like to run
- Livesplit will download the autosplitter automatically and you are ready to run
- If not: Open "Splits Editor" (right click - edit splits) and select "Biohazard" or "Resident Evil" as Game Name and hit the "Activate"-Button.

3. I WANT TO USE THE NEW AUTOSPLITTER WITH MY OLD SPLITS (for keeping PB-times, etc.)
- Start your Livesplit and load up the biohazard splits you like to run
- Livesplit will download the autosplitter automatically (if not: Splits Editor - Game Name: "Biohazard" or "Resident Evil")
- Open "Splits Editor" (right click - edit layout)
- You need to rename the following splits (without "" - watch caption â€“ working for Jill and Chris - after renaming you are ready to go):
<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3KjVXjp.png" alt="Mansion 1" width="400" height="300"></td>
    <td>Last Mansion 1 split: <br>"Mansion 1"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/p2DC6k2.png" alt="Mansion 1" width="400" height="300"></td>
    <td>Last Courtyard split before entering Guardhouse: <br>"Courtyard 1"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WzsxSpF.png" alt="Mansion 1" width="400" height="300"></td>
    <td>Last Guardhouse split: <br>"Guardhouse"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OAOa34D.png" alt="Mansion 1" width="400" height="300"></td>
    <td>Last Courtyard split before reentering Mansion: <br>"Courtyard 2"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sivIxHM.png" alt="Mansion 1" width="400" height="300"></td>
    <td>Last Mansion 2 split: <br>"Mansion 2"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/a1oT5Xn.png" alt="Mansion 1" width="400" height="300"></td>
    <td>Last Courtyard split before going into Underground: <br>"Courtyard 3"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zfFEJbF.png" alt="Mansion 1" width="400" height="300"></td>
    <td>Last Underground split before entering labs: <br>"Underground"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sjsgpSI.png" alt="Mansion 1" width="400" height="300"></td>
    <td>Last Split: <br>"Laboratory - End"</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
You can add, delete and rename all other splits like you want. Important: The very last split has to be the name "Laboratory - End" or "End", otherwise your splits can end early.<br>
Watch out: If you put more splits into a section than you are really using (for example you normally need 4 splits to cross Courtyard from Mansion to Guardhouse - but you have 10 splits here) the splits will stop until you had this amount of splits (doors, ladders, etc.) in this section. Timer will still be running so the run is still valid.
